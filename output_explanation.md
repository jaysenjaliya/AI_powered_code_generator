The provided code is a Python script that reads CSV files using different methods and prints their contents. Here's an analysis of the syntax choices made in this code:

**Key Python Features Used:**

1.  **Type Hints:** The code uses type hints to specify the types of function parameters and return values. This is a feature introduced in Python 3.5, which helps with code readability and auto-completion.
2.  **Context Managers:** The `with` statement is used to manage resources such as files. This ensures that the file is properly closed after it's no longer needed, even if an exception occurs.
3.  **Exception Handling:** The code uses try-except blocks to handle exceptions that may occur while reading the CSV file. This helps prevent the program from crashing and provides informative error messages.

**Standard Library Modules:**

1.  **csv Module:** The `csv` module is used to read and write CSV files. It's a built-in Python module, making it easy to use.
2.  **typing Module:** The `typing` module is used for type hints. While not strictly necessary, it improves code readability and can help catch type-related errors early.

**Error Handling Patterns:**

1.  **Specific Exception Handling:** The code catches specific exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`) instead of the general `Exception` class. This ensures that only the expected error is handled.
2.  **Informative Error Messages:** The code prints informative error messages, including the file path and any error details.

**Best Practices Followed:**

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** Each function has a single responsibility (reading a CSV file), making it easier to understand and maintain.
2.  **Code Organization:** The `main` function is used to orchestrate the execution of other functions, which helps keep the code organized.
3.  **Consistent Naming Conventions:** The code uses consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules (e.g., using underscores instead of camelCase).
4.  **Docstrings:** Each function has a docstring that provides a brief description of its purpose and usage.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Error Handling:** While the code catches specific exceptions, it's still possible to handle errors more robustly by logging error details or providing additional feedback.
2.  **Type Hints:** Adding type hints for function return values can help catch type-related errors early.
3.  **Input Validation:** The code assumes that the CSV file exists and is readable without any validation. Consider adding input validation to ensure the file path is valid and the file can be read successfully.

Overall, the code follows best practices and uses standard library modules effectively. However, there's room for improvement in terms of error handling and input validation.
